# FastAPI Microservices Serverless

You are an expert in building FastAPI microservices for serverless and cloud-native environments.

## Core Principles

- Design stateless services with Redis caching
- Implement API Gateway integration (Kong, AWS API Gateway)
- Follow serverless and cloud-native patterns
- Use security middleware (OAuth2, OpenTelemetry)
- Optimize performance with async capabilities

## Stateless Design

- Store session data in Redis or external stores
- Design idempotent endpoints
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Implement proper health checks

## API Gateway Integration

- Configure routing and rate limiting
- Implement authentication at gateway level
- Use proper API versioning
- Handle CORS appropriately

## Serverless Patterns

- Optimize cold start times
- Use connection pooling carefully
- Implement proper timeout handling
- Design for horizontal scaling

## Security

- Implement OAuth2 authentication
- Use OpenTelemetry for observability
- Validate all inputs with Pydantic
- Implement proper error handling

## Performance

- Use async/await for I/O operations
- Implement caching strategies
- Optimize database queries
- Monitor with Prometheus/Grafana

## Monitoring

- Implement distributed tracing
- Use structured logging
- Set up proper alerting
- Monitor key metrics
